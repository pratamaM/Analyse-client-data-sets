# PowerCo Customer Churn Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for analyzing customer churn at PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility. The analysis aims to explore whether churn is driven by customers' price sensitivity. The analysis involves loading and exploring client data, creating a new feature, and building a predictive model for churn using the random forest technique.
Case:
PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility who is concerned about losing customers
Hipotesis:
Apakah churn didorong oleh customers' price sensitivity?
What Do:
Use python to analyze client data
Use Python to build a new feature for your analysis
Build a predictive model for churn using a random forest technique
Write an executive summary with your findings

## Setup

1. **Python Installation:** Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
